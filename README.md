## Git Practices for Version Control  

### Basic Git Commands  
- **Initialize a Repository:**  
  ```bash
  git init
  ```  
- **Clone a Repository:**  
  ```bash
  git clone <repository_url>
  ```  
- **Stage and Commit Changes:**  
  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Your commit message"
  ```  
- **Push Changes to GitHub:**  
  ```bash
  git push origin main
  ```  
- **Pull Changes from Remote:**  
  ```bash
  git pull origin main
  ```  

### Common Git Scenarios  
1. **Removing a File from the Repository:**  
   ```bash
   git rm --cached <file_path>
   ```  
   Donâ€™t forget to update your `.gitignore` to prevent it from being tracked again.

2. **Resolving Merge Conflicts:**  
   - Open conflicting files and resolve the differences.  
   - Stage resolved files using `git add`.  
   - Commit the changes:  
     ```bash
     git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts"
     ```

## Additional Tips  
- Add `.iml` and other IDE-generated files to your `.gitignore` to avoid cluttering the repository.  
- Regularly sync your local repository with the remote to prevent conflicts.
